## Important Note
- All dates and times must be entered in the format `d/M/yyyy HHmm` (e.g., `15/2/2025 1400`).
- Invalid date entries (e.g., `30/2/2025`) will result in an error.
- Tasks are automatically saved in a text file within a dedicated folder located in the same directory as your JAR file.
  Do not modify the text file, move the folder, or relocate the JAR file, as this may cause data loss or corruption.
